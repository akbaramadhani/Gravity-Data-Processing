This script is aim to get Bouger Anomaly data using parasnis density.

Step :
1. Download this code and extract.
2. Prepare gravity data from topex website and download.
3. Use file Data_Format.csv template to use in processing.
4. Run script.
5. When running the script, the terminal is asked to copy the coefficient value listed in the terminal, copy the value, then enter.
6. At the end, you get file named Bouger Anomaly Result.xlsx.
